# Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon Modding Editor and SDK

An O3DE-based, evidence-governed authoring environment for creating, validating, packaging, and eventually deploying mods for **Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon**.

> **Project status: pre-alpha.** The editor foundation and first specialised domain tool are under active development. The project is not yet a complete mod-production toolchain and must not be treated as a safe runtime executor.

This repository is a fork of Open 3D Engine. O3DE supplies the editor host, UI framework, build system, asset tooling, reflection, automation, and extensibility. Tainted Grail remains a separate Unity runtime target.

## Project goals

The project is building a public modding editor and SDK that can:

- describe an exact FoA installation and game build;
- create pack-owned mod projects and manifests;
- import and fingerprint research, diagnostics, dumps, observations, logs, screenshots, CSV, JSON, and Avalon Core source sets;
- preserve exact native references, GUIDs, paths, aliases, versions, and evidence;
- maintain a canonical, queryable game-knowledge catalog;
- assess maturity, confidence, operational risk, validation, staleness, permissions, prohibitions, and supersession independently;
- author items, recipes, actors, troops, spawns, routes, factions, quests, state, assets, and localisation through shared governed data;
- generate reviewed work orders and manifests for separately validated FoA runtime adapters;
- provide a controlled validate, generate, build, package, deploy, launch, capture, and evidence workflow.

## Safety and architecture boundary

The editor and Avalon Core knowledge layer do **not** execute gameplay actions.

They may:

- manage workspaces and pack ownership;
- import and preserve evidence;
- query and inspect game knowledge;
- validate references and relationships;
- record reviewed governance decisions and usage constraints;
- author typed domain data on canonical records;
- produce blockers, permissions, plans, and handoff documents;
- build editor-owned packages and reports.

They must not directly:

- call FoA game APIs;
- patch the game with Harmony;
- load BepInEx plugins into the game;
- spawn actors or encounters;
- grant items or learn recipes;
- append recipes or register custom templates;
- mutate quests, saves, vendors, loot, rewards, or world state;
- claim runtime safety without the required evidence, validation, and reviewed permission decision.

Native execution belongs to separate adapters with their own compatibility, persistence, cleanup, and rollback gates.

## Current editor tools

The `TaintedGrailModdingSDK` Gem currently registers these O3DE tools under **Tools → Tainted Grail SDK**.

### Tainted Grail SDK Status

Configures and reports:

- workspace identity and paths;
- exact FoA game profile;
- Mono or IL2CPP target;
- Unity and BepInEx versions;
- pack, source, evidence, catalog, governance, economy, and blocker totals;
- catalog coverage and validation blockers.

Workspace documents use the `*.tgworkspace.json` suffix.

### Tainted Grail Pack Manager

Creates and opens governed `*.tgpack.json` manifests containing:

- stable namespaced pack ID and owner;
- semantic version;
- game, Avalon Core, and adapter compatibility;
- dependencies, required mods, and incompatibilities;
- save-impact declaration;
- content, asset, and localisation declarations;
- build configuration and release channel.

Runtime actions are always persisted as disabled.

### Tainted Grail Source Intake

Imports and fingerprints source artifacts using:

- structured JSON evidence extraction;
- structured CSV evidence extraction;
- generic artifact registration without inferred evidence.

Every source is bound to the active profile ID, exact game version, branch, and runtime target. Durable files are written under:

```text
Sources/<source-id>/source.tgsource.json
Sources/<source-id>/evidence.tgevidence.json
```

### Tainted Grail Catalog Browser

Provides:

- exact native-reference and GUID search;
- search by record ID, subject, alias, domain, kind, pack, confidence, risk, validation, staleness, permission, evidence, blocker state, and supersession;
- inspection of identity, pack ownership, evidence, relationships, validation and governance history, conflicts, missing refs, prohibitions, and blockers;
- evidence-backed promotion into reviewed-but-unvalidated canonical records;
- durable `Catalog/catalog.tgcatalog.json` persistence bound to the active workspace and exact game profile.

Catalog records are never merged by display name. Claim promotion cannot grant allowed usage and automatically adds `no_unvalidated_runtime_use`.

### Tainted Grail Catalog Governance

Provides reviewed authoring of independent states for both records and relationships:

- maturity/research stage;
- confidence;
- operational risk;
- validation state and proof history;
- staleness/current-build assessment;
- named usage permissions and prohibitions;
- supersession.

Validation does not grant permission. An allowed usage requires a separate permission decision backed by a successful validation event for the same catalog subject. Marking a subject stale or superseded automatically removes allowed usages.

### Tainted Grail Item and Recipe Editor

The first specialised domain tool authors typed economy data on existing canonical records:

- item categories, values, stack, weight, quality, rarity, durability, quest/unique flags, localisation, icon, and asset references;
- recipe type, tab, station records, unlock data, duplicate key, persistence description, and hidden state;
- typed ingredient joins with quantity, substitutions, consumption, conditions, and evidence;
- typed outputs and by-products with quantity, chance, conditions, and evidence;
- first-class acquisition relationships such as `sold_by`, `dropped_by`, `found_at`, `rewarded_by`, `learned_from`, `granted_by`, and `crafted_at`;
- read-only action-lane matrices derived from Catalog Governance.

An item identity remains separate from a recipe identity. The tool does not create canonical identities or execute any displayed action lane.

## Development roadmap

The active roadmap is maintained in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Major capability areas are:

1. workspace and exact game-profile management;
2. mod and content-pack project management;
3. source and evidence intake;
4. canonical catalog browser and record inspector;
5. validation, maturity, risk, and permission engine;
6. specialised domain authoring tools;
7. typed FoA adapter contracts;
8. build, package, deploy, test, and evidence capture.

The remaining repository content is inherited from O3DE and remains subject to O3DE's build, licence, and contribution requirements.

## Building

This fork uses the standard O3DE source build process. Follow the upstream O3DE source-build requirements for your platform, configure the engine with a supported compiler and third-party package cache, and build the O3DE Editor host.

Before opening a pull request, run:

```shell
python Gems/TaintedGrailModdingSDK/Tools/validate_foundation.py
python Gems/TaintedGrailModdingSDK/Tools/validate_catalog_tests.py
```

A complete contribution must also pass the catalog/governance/economy unit tests, repository validation workflow, and applicable O3DE host build jobs.

## Branch and review model

The public project uses two long-lived branches:

- `main` — reviewed, integrated project state;
- `foa-development` — the single active development line.

Direct development on `main` is prohibited. Significant changes require design review before implementation, self-review before push, a pull request, successful required checks, and maintainer approval before merge. See [Review and merge policy](docs/tainted-grail-sdk/REVIEW_AND_MERGE_POLICY.md).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before filing an issue or changing code.

All commits must include Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off:

```shell
git commit -s -m "Describe the change"
```

Contributors must follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), code-quality rules, evidence governance, and review requirements.

## Security

Do not disclose vulnerabilities, unsafe deployment paths, or save-corruption risks in public issues. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Licence and upstream attribution

This repository retains the O3DE licence files and third-party notices at the repository root. Contributions must be compatible with those terms.
