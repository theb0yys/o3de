# Changelog

All notable changes to the Tainted Grail Modding Editor and SDK are documented here.

The project follows the principles of Keep a Changelog. Version numbers follow Semantic Versioning once public releases begin. During pre-alpha development, entries may describe capability slices before a tagged release exists.

### Changed

- Phase 7 now includes deterministic work-order plan generation; the next ordered contract is a runtime-result evidence envelope.
- The focused TG SDK workflow and catalog-test validator enforce work-order planning, exact subject/payload rebuilding, canonical serialization, and the no-persistence/no-execution boundary.
- The Windows manual UI checklist opens all ten TG SDK panes and verifies the default no-declaration state as one refused candidate with zero generated steps.
- Phase 7 includes the adapter capability contract foundation and retains the typed compatibility matrix as the prerequisite planning gate.
- Phase 6 records both economy acquisition coverage and exact cross-pack duplicate reporting as implemented.
- Duplicate detection uses only exact, case-sensitive subject references and recipe duplicate keys across distinct owner packs; it performs no display-name or fuzzy matching.
- Production implementation files are compiled exactly once by Core, Framework, or Editor; catalog and path-policy tests link `Framework.Static` instead of recompiling private copies of production `.cpp` files.
- The Editor Gem target owns only Qt views, the Editor system component, and module composition; persistence, path policy, loading, and Foundation orchestration are owned by `Framework.Static`.
- The focused TG SDK workflow runs the Core/Framework validator and its focused unit tests before the existing Developer Preview and foundation contracts.
- Workspace loading builds and validates a complete candidate before publishing any workspace, canonical path, registry, import issue, catalog, catalog path, or snapshot state.
- Workspace persistence emits explicit schema-1 JSON; unversioned schema-0 documents are migrated only when every current invariant can be validated safely.
- The focused TG SDK workflow runs the atomic workspace/schema contract validator in addition to Developer Preview, path-policy, governance, catalog, and source-policy checks.
- The focused TG SDK workflow runs Developer Preview command, project-integration, opener, fixture, launch, diagnostics, and manual UI evidence tests; command/project/fixture/persistence/launch-diagnostics/manual-evidence contract validators; clean fixture generation/verification; and a clean diagnostics collect→verify cycle before existing foundation, governance, catalog, and source-policy checks.
- A dedicated Windows workflow validates the product-host project, icon assets, command-line opener, low-level shortcut generator, hardened clickable entry, dry-run plan, and a real COM-created `.lnk`.
- `AutomatedTesting` is restored to its upstream engine-testing role and no longer enables or hosts the TG SDK preview product.
- The catalog test target links the real persistence services and receives the reviewed fixture-template path for service-level smoke coverage.
- Catalog compatibility loading preserves current validated allowances only when the latest reviewed permission event has valid proof for the same subject; unproven legacy allowances still fail closed.
- Release and maintainer procedures require exact-commit Windows manual UI evidence, screenshot hashes, privacy review, verifier success, and non-commit handling before a Developer Preview claim.
- Catalog records carry an explicit staleness state.
- Catalog relationships use the same independent maturity, confidence, risk, validation, staleness, permission, prohibition, conflict, missing-reference, and supersession model as records.
- Record and relationship governance transitions execute through one typed state machine instead of duplicated branches.
- Governance and validation APIs accept immutable catalog inputs and return complete state-plus-history candidates only after all in-memory checks succeed.
- Catalog publication occurs only from a successful `CatalogTransactionService` result after persistence completes.
- Validation events can target records or relationships while retaining the legacy record-only binding for schema-1 compatibility.
- Canonical catalog schema 1 accepts optional governance-history, typed economy arrays, and extended state fields without reinterpreting existing identity data.
- Foundation status snapshots count relationships, validation events, governance decisions, typed item/recipe profiles, recipe joins, stale subjects, allowed usages, and prohibitions.
- Catalog blockers cover missing evidence, missing pack ownership, conflicts, missing refs, unvalidated state, permission-before-validation, invalid supersession, relationship evidence, validation-profile mismatches, governance proof gaps, and economy authoring gaps.
- The roadmap advances Phase 6 with the Item and Recipe Editor and its first station/learnability evidence coverage view.

### Security

- Work-order plans are transient, immutable descriptions only; `ExecutionAllowed` is false on every plan and step, and no save, export, dispatch, adapter invocation, code generation, process access, deployment, launch, telemetry, or save mutation is added.
- Whole-plan refusal and independent exact-subject rebuilding prevent a partially compatible adapter or unreviewed aggregate subject from producing a plan step.
- Adapter declarations are transient metadata only; Slice 8 adds no adapter document, loader, process access, BepInEx/Harmony execution, deployment, game launch, save mutation, or runtime adapter implementation.
- Adapter compatibility is fail-closed and ordered as support → version → permission → proof; `supported` never authorizes execution and requires exact active-profile source/evidence and same-subject permission/validation proof.
- Economy duplicate analysis is immutable and fail-closed; the report cannot merge records, reject packs, select a winner, author governance, persist changes, or expose runtime/deployment actions.
- Exact duplicate signals are case-sensitive and pack-gated; display names, aliases, localisation, tags, asset paths, inferred semantics, and fuzzy similarity cannot create a duplicate group.
- Economy coverage analysis is immutable and fail-closed; the dashboard exposes no editing, governance, persistence, deployment, launch, injection, vendor/loot/reward mutation, recipe learning, or save behavior.
- The Core/Framework split remains host-tool-only and exposes no internal static target through Tool or Builder aliases; it adds no runtime adapter, deployment, launch, injection, telemetry, or save behavior.
- Failed workspace candidates cannot publish partial objects, change the live canonical workspace path, redirect pack containment, or replace the previous Foundation snapshot.
- Workspace root, output, staging, deployment, diagnostics, extracted-data, managed-assembly, and Mono plugin paths are validated before publication and save.
- Developer Preview fixture generation performs no network access or process launch and refuses silent overwrite of unrelated, partial, modified, or symlink-containing output directories.
- Fixture verification rejects absolute/private paths, secret-like material, path traversal, borrowed native identities, ownership mismatches, unknown evidence, malformed relationships, and binding drift.
- The persistence smoke uses temporary workspace roots only, performs no runtime or deployment action, and verifies proof-backed permission preservation separately from legacy fail-closed cleanup.
- The Editor launch wrapper accepts only `Editor.exe`, constructs only the documented optional `--project-path` argument, uses no shell command strings or arbitrary passthrough arguments, and never launches FoA or runtime tooling.
- The project opener selects only `TaintedGrailModdingEditor`, validates the dedicated project contract before launch, and delegates to the existing restricted launch wrapper.
- The low-level shortcut generator uses a fixed PowerShell COM script with explicit environment values, creates no desktop entry silently, exposes no arbitrary Editor arguments, and records the generated `.lnk` size and SHA-256.
- The supported clickable-entry command inspects the real Windows shortcut target, project arguments, working directory, icon, and description, and verifies an existing generated entry before `--replace` can remove it.
- Diagnostics collection is explicit and local-only, excludes source artifact contents, game files, saves, environment variables, credentials, binary logs, and unrestricted filesystem listings, and performs no automatic upload.
- Diagnostics verification enforces relative allow-listed paths, size limits, UTF-8 text, SHA-256 hashes, symlink/traversal rejection, and path/secret redaction before a bundle can be replaced or shared.
- Manual UI evidence tooling does not capture screenshots, automate UI coordinates, inspect screenshot pixels, perform OCR, access the network, or upload evidence.
- Screenshot attachment requires explicit privacy and project-owned-content review; final verification requires exact commit binding, successful launch, activation-log confirmation, all checklist items passing, required screenshot coverage, and disclosure/runtime attestations.
- Generated screenshots must remain beneath `build/` or outside the repository and are not release package contents.
- Developer Preview commands do not install dependencies silently, use shell command strings, launch FoA, invoke runtime adapters, deploy files, modify saves, or collect telemetry.
- Preview build-directory validation rejects the repository root, directories containing the checkout, `.git` paths, unrelated non-empty directories, and CMake caches bound to another source tree.
- Runtime execution remains disabled in editor-owned workspace, pack, source/evidence, catalog, validation, governance, typed economy, adapter-contract, and work-order-planning workflows.
- Source intake rejects missing or mismatched profile and fingerprint bindings.
- Structured imports are size-limited and fail closed on malformed schemas.
- Catalog promotion cannot grant allowed usages and adds `no_unvalidated_runtime_use`.
- Validation never grants permission automatically.
- Allowed usage requires a separate reviewed permission event backed by validated proof for the same subject.
- Stale, failed, blocked, and superseded transitions remove existing allowed usages.
- A failed governance-history append cannot leave changed state in a caller-owned catalog.
- A failed catalog save cannot publish a candidate into the live editor state.
- Item/recipe profile and join writes reject missing or unrelated evidence before persistence.
- Native and synthetic item/recipe lanes are checked independently.
- Quest-sensitive and unique item distribution lanes receive explicit blockers.
- The Item and Recipe Editor exposes governance lanes and recipe station/learnability research as read-only status and cannot grant permission.
- Missing, mismatched, unresolved, stale, blocked, conflicted, missing-reference, and superseded station/learnability inputs fail closed.
- Public contribution rules require design review, pre-commit self-review, required CI, resolved review threads, and maintainer approval before merge.

### Known limitations

- Generated work-order plans are planning evidence only; they are not persisted, exported, dispatched, executed, deployed, or returned to an adapter.
- The runtime-result evidence envelope, actual runtime adapters, execution, cleanup/rollback reporting, and runtime proof capture are not implemented.
- Adapter declarations are transient and cleared on Editor shutdown; there is no declaration persistence or registration UI, so normal Developer Preview sessions display `unsupported` rows and refused plans by default.
- Cross-pack duplicate groups are review candidates only; they do not confirm semantic equivalence, choose a canonical winner, authorize deletion, or prove a runtime conflict.
- Economy acquisition coverage is research-only: it does not prove actual vendor stock, loot tables, reward delivery, recipe learning, crafting availability, runtime registration, persistence, cleanup, or rollback.
- The Windows manual UI checklist and evidence verifier are implemented, but the actual Windows screenshot pass remains pending.
- Developer Preview 0 does not include a prebuilt or verified preview archive; the Editor must be built from source before the clickable `.lnk` is generated.
- The service-level smoke and controlled Editor process path do not themselves prove every pane visually on a real Windows desktop or prove FoA runtime compatibility.
- The UI evidence verifier checks metadata and file integrity but cannot inspect screenshot pixels; human privacy review remains mandatory.
- The evidence view reports station visibility and recipe learnability research but does not append, learn, register, persist, clean up, roll back, or prove runtime behavior.
- Runtime append, custom registration, vendor/loot mutation, reward mutation, persistence, cleanup, and rollback remain adapter-side research or implementation work.
- Catalog permission usage names remain schema-compatible strings; typed adapter capabilities map to the reviewed economy usage vocabulary without changing schema 1.
- Remaining actor, spawn, world, faction, quest/state, asset, and localisation authoring tools are not implemented.
- FoA runtime adapters and production deployment are not implemented.
- The project has not published a supported binary release.
