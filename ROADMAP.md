# Tainted Grail Modding Editor and SDK Roadmap

This roadmap describes capability order, not promised dates. Work advances only when architecture, evidence, validation, documentation, tests, and build quality are sufficient.

## Guiding rule

Every authoring feature uses the shared workspace, pack ownership, source/evidence, canonical catalog, validation, risk, staleness, permission, prohibition, and blocker infrastructure. Domain tools do not create private identity systems, grant their own permissions, or bypass blockers.

## Phase 0 — Project foundation

Status: implemented, continuing hardening.

- O3DE editor Gem and host-tool registration.
- Editor-only product boundary.
- Focused repository validation and public governance/documentation.
- Two-branch development model: `main` and `foa-development`.

## Phase 1 — Workspace and exact game profile

Status: implemented, continuing hardening.

- Workspace identity and canonical paths.
- Exact FoA version, branch, runtime target, Unity/BepInEx versions, assemblies, diagnostics, and extracted-data locations.
- Durable workspace schema 1 with legacy migration and atomic all-or-nothing publication.
- Blockers for incomplete identity and unsafe paths.

## Phase 2 — Mod and content-pack projects

Status: implemented, continuing hardening.

- Pack-owned stable identities and semantic versions.
- Core, adapter, game, mod, DLC, and incompatibility declarations.
- Save-impact, content, asset, localisation, build, and release declarations.
- Durable pack manifests with runtime actions disabled.

## Phase 3 — Source and evidence intake

Status: implemented, continuing hardening.

- SHA-256 fingerprinting and exact profile/build binding.
- Structured JSON/CSV extraction and bounded generic-artifact intake.
- Durable source/evidence documents and import issues.
- No automatic catalog promotion, validation, or permission.

## Phase 4 — Canonical catalog browser and record inspector

Status: implemented, continuing hardening.

- Durable `Catalog/catalog.tgcatalog.json` bound to workspace/profile/version/branch.
- Stable records, first-class relationships, validation history, and governance history.
- Exact-reference/GUID, identity, pack, evidence, governance, blocker, and supersession search.
- Reviewed claim promotion without display-name identity merging.
- Native exact-reference uniqueness, synthetic pack ownership, and save-before-publish transactions.

## Phase 5 — Validation, maturity, risk, and permission engine

Status: implemented, continuing hardening.

- Independent maturity, confidence, operational risk, validation, staleness, permission, prohibition, and supersession states.
- Usage-specific allow, forbid, and clear decisions.
- Validation and governance history bound to exact subjects, profiles, evidence, reviewers, and proof.
- Stale, failed, blocked, and superseded subjects lose allowed usage.
- Dedicated **Tainted Grail Catalog Governance** pane and rollback/persistence hardening tests.

## Phase 6 — Domain authoring tools

Status: active development.

All domain tools use canonical IDs, source/evidence provenance, governance decisions, blockers, and the shared catalog transaction boundary.

### Economy and content

#### Item and Recipe Editor

Status: implemented, continuing hardening and evidence coverage.

- Typed item/recipe profiles, stations, ingredients, outputs, by-products, unlocks, and acquisition relationships.
- Separate native, synthetic, append, registration, vendor/loot, reward, asset, and localisation lanes.

- No item or recipe authoring command invokes FoA runtime code.

#### Economy acquisition coverage dashboard

Status: implemented, continuing hardening and Windows UI verification.

- Pure Core vendor, loot, reward, learnability, and crafting coverage.
- Deterministic `covered`, `partial`, `blocked`, and `missing` states.

#### Economy cross-pack duplicate report

Status: implemented, continuing hardening and Windows UI verification.

- Exact case-sensitive cross-pack grouping by economy subject reference and recipe duplicate key.
- Deterministic `review_required`, `partial`, and `blocked` health.
- No display-name, alias, localisation, tag, asset-path, case-folded, or fuzzy matching.
- Read-only review candidates only: no merge, rejection, winner selection, or runtime action.

#### Remaining economy work

- Extend typed planning contracts as later domain tools become implemented.
- Keep runtime behavior in separately reviewed adapters.

### Actors and population

Status: active development. Core contracts, CatalogDatabase integration, and durable catalog schema-2
migration/persistence are implemented; Framework authoring is next.

- Typed actor profiles, troop profiles, and troop membership with exact canonical identity and evidence
  boundaries.

### Remaining Phase 8 release work

Controlled pipeline:

```text
validate → generate → build → package → deploy → launch → capture → attach evidence
```

Remaining Phase 8 work includes controlled package assembly, trusted filesystem inventory and hashing, trusted
identity/time providers, acknowledgement and key custody, actual backup/restore and deployment implementations,
actual independent verifier execution and target access, cryptographic signing and verification, publication
results, and separately reviewed runtime adapters.

## Phase 9 — Ecosystem and automation

- Importer plugin SDK and domain-tool extensions.
- Headless validation and packaging.
- Public schema packages, CI fixtures, compatibility matrices, and migration tooling.
- Documentation and examples for third-party adapters.

### External authoring tools and engine interchange

Status: Gate 0 contract-only precursor in development; Phase 9 provider and execution work remains proposed.

- Gate 0 adds only inert Core handoff/result envelopes, canonical bindings, validation, tests, and
  documentation. It introduces no service, process, filesystem, provider, build, deployment, or runtime
  authority and does not change the active Phase 6 first-party domain order.

- Use ordinary O3DE Tool Gems and the existing `ExternalToolchain` host; do not add another plugin loader.
- Qualify the in-tree DCCsi Blender integration and Scene Exporter against exact supported Blender versions.
- Add separate `foa.blender` and `foa.unity-editor` provider Gems with discovery-only first slices.
- Define a deterministic FBX-plus-sidecar interchange for project-owned assets, identities, provenance,
  transformations, losses, validation evidence, and exact toolchain locks.
- Add a Unity editor-only interchange package for synthetic or user-owned test projects.
- Keep the Unity authoring lane separate from FoA runtime adapters, BepInEx/Harmony execution, deployment,
  game launch, and save mutation.
- Treat glTF/GLB and USD as later qualification candidates instead of claiming current cross-engine support.
- Preserve the existing `ExternalToolchain` follow-on order: separately review host process supervision before
  provider execution, and keep structured IPC or live connection behind later independent gates.

[Editor Toolchain and Unity Interchange Design](docs/tainted-grail-sdk/EDITOR_TOOLCHAIN_UNITY_INTERCHANGE_DESIGN.md).
The exact Gate 0 boundary is documented in
[External Tool Interchange Gate 0](docs/tainted-grail-sdk/EXTERNAL_TOOL_INTERCHANGE_GATE_0.md).

## Cross-cutting requirements

Every phase preserves exact identity, pack ownership, evidence provenance, independent governance axes, fail-closed validation and permission, editor/runtime separation, durable schema versioning, legal redistribution boundaries, accessibility, usable errors, public documentation, and executable tests.

## Not roadmap commitments

This document does not promise release dates, support every game patch, guarantee compatibility with private mods, or authorise runtime actions that have not passed the required validation and permission gates.
