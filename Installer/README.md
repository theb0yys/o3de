# FOA-SDK installer and suite system

`Installer/` is the product-owned source root for installing, repairing, upgrading, and removing the FOA-SDK suite.

It owns installer source and declarative package recipes. It does **not** contain generated MSI files, portable ZIP archives, staged payloads, build caches, receipts, screenshots, signing material, or release uploads. Generated output belongs beneath the external `foa-build/` root or another reviewed output directory.

No additional top-level `Assets/`, `Packages/`, `Tests/`, `Schemas/`, `Build/`, or `Tools/` roots are required. Those materials remain beneath the product subsystem that owns them.

## Suite wizard

The suite wizard is the user-facing selection and review surface. It may present reviewed choices such as:

- the FOA-SDK Editor and mandatory foundation;
- optional authoring plug-ins;
- optional tool integrations;
- optional Mono or IL2CPP runtime-adapter packages;
- documentation, examples, and developer components.

The wizard must display exact versions, source provenance, licence state, compatibility, required disk space, dependencies, conflicts, elevation requirements, planned filesystem changes and required acknowledgements before confirmation. It must support dry-run, repair, upgrade, uninstall, and rollback-aware review.

`Installer/SuiteWizard/Catalog/` provides the engine-neutral discovery and selection interface. It emits reviewed suite/package/feature rows with an exact `catalog_sha256`, binds explicit choices into a `selection_sha256`, rejects stale catalogue state, then delegates resolution and presentation to the existing resolver and view-model contracts.

`Installer/SuiteWizard/Host/` provides the current native graphical review host. It renders the exact catalogue fingerprint, suite/package/feature rows and compatibility context, translates user controls into explicit selection inputs, and displays the resolver-owned package order, planned files, warnings, acknowledgements and complete review fingerprint chain. It contains no confirmation or execution control.

The wizard does not resolve packages itself. It submits explicit selections, exclusions, features, and compatibility context to `Installer/SuiteWizard/Resolver/`, then displays the returned canonical plan and diagnostics without weakening them. Dependency closure, version constraints, compatibility, conflicts, path safety, legal state, deterministic ordering, payload collision detection, and plan fingerprinting remain resolver-owned logic.

`Installer/SuiteWizard/ViewModel/` verifies the resolver plan, derives stable UI rows and required acknowledgements, and creates a review-only confirmation bound to exact `plan_sha256` and `view_model_sha256` values. Any catalogue, selection, plan, display-model, acknowledgement or confirmation mutation invalidates the current review chain.

A valid resolution plan and confirmation are still non-executable. A separately reviewed acquisition or execution layer must later reverify both artifacts before receiving any operational capability.

A selection never grants game-launch, runtime-execution, deployment, save-mutation, signing, publication, catalog-mutation, or evidence-promotion authority. A confirmation also grants no acquisition, installation, elevation, or any of those operational authorities.

## Bootstrapper

The bootstrapper owns bounded prerequisite checks and the verified transition into the suite wizard or package engine. It may resolve reviewed package sources only after exact identity, version, hash, signature policy, licence, and compatibility checks pass.

It must fail closed for unavailable prerequisites, hash drift, unsupported operating systems, unknown packages, dependency cycles, unsafe paths, unreviewed redistribution, unexpected elevation, and partial acquisition. Network access and elevation are explicit capabilities, never defaults.

## Suites and packages

Each suite lives at `Installer/Suites/<Suite>/suite.json` and conforms to `suite.schema.json`.

Each installable package lives at `Installer/Packages/<Package>/package.json` and conforms to `package.schema.json`.

Suite definitions reference package IDs; they do not duplicate payload inventories. Package definitions describe reviewed source, compatibility, dependencies, payload ownership, install scope, lifecycle behavior, legal status, and permanent authority prohibitions.

Plug-in package manifests remain under `Plugins/`. Installer package definitions may reference those plug-ins, but do not replace `plugin.json` or bypass ExtensionAPI registration.

## Deterministic resolver

The engine-neutral resolver lives at `Installer/SuiteWizard/Resolver/`. Its public entry point is `Source/suite_package_resolver.py`, and its canonical output conforms to `plan.schema.json`.

For identical suite bytes, package-manifest bytes, explicit selections and compatibility context, the resolver emits byte-identical canonical JSON and the same `plan_sha256`. It includes required/default/optional selection decisions, dependency reasons, dependency-first package order, exact manifest fingerprints, payload inventory, total file count and size, elevation state, legal state, warnings and permanent authority boundaries.

The resolver performs no acquisition, file copying, installation, repair, upgrade, rollback, uninstall, elevation, game launch, runtime execution, deployment, save mutation, signing or publication.

## Wizard view-model and confirmation

The engine-neutral view-model contract lives at `Installer/SuiteWizard/ViewModel/`. It emits canonical JSON conforming to `view-model.schema.json`, including exact package rows, flattened payload rows, warnings, policies, totals, acknowledgement requirements and `view_model_sha256`.

`confirmation.schema.json` defines a review-only record bound to the exact plan and view-model hashes, the complete acknowledgement set, caller-supplied identity and caller-supplied UTC time. Confirmation generation reads no clock or environment state and grants no execution authority.

## Existing Windows packaging

The current reviewed Windows MSI/portable workflow is owned beneath `Installer/Packaging/Windows/`. It converts an already verified staging payload into an unsigned development MSI or portable ZIP. It does not select unreviewed files, publish releases, sign artifacts, modify FoA, or remove external workspaces.

The installed Editor launcher source is owned beneath `Installer/Launcher/Windows/` and remains built through the required SDK foundation target until the suite bootstrapper has its own reviewed build graph.

## Acceptance boundary

Installer changes require, as applicable:

1. canonical schema validation;
2. deterministic suite and package resolution;
3. deterministic catalogue discovery, stale-selection rejection and exact selection fingerprints;
4. graphical host coverage for required/default/optional controls, refresh invalidation and resolver-backed review rows;
5. deterministic view-model and exact-hash confirmation;
6. dependency/conflict and compatibility tests;
7. path, symlink, case-collision, and traversal rejection;
8. exact inventory, hash, provenance, licence, and redistribution review;
9. clean install, repair, upgrade, rollback, and uninstall smoke tests;
10. preservation of external workspaces and user-authored content;
11. generated-output hygiene;
12. explicit proof that no release, signing, runtime, deployment, save, acquisition, installation or elevation authority was introduced by review-only contracts.
