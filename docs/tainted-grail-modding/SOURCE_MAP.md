# Upstream Source Map

## Baseline

All initial rows are bound to `theb0yys/Tainted-Grail-The-Fall-of-Avalon-mods` commit `d7e740e7f167b73152b53409e483dab07d80d048`.

Status values:

- `existing-owner` — FOA-SDK already has the canonical result;
- `planned-adapt` — rewrite for the current SDK and handbook;
- `planned-extract` — extract structured facts, patterns, or records;
- `research-only` — preserve and investigate before publication;
- `blocked-payload` — do not copy the payload;
- `superseded` — historical workflow is replaced by the current SDK contract.

## Existing selective ports

The current `Research/tainted-grail-system-ports/` track remains the canonical migration owner for:

- Tainted Framework;
- Tainted Interface;
- Avalon Core and Road Atlas;
- provider-neutral acquisition observations;
- Avalon AI API 2.0 authoring contracts;
- optional Merlin integration;
- separate inert Mono and IL2CPP route contracts.

The handbook links to those results and explains their use. It does not create a second framework, UI, road, AI, provider, or adapter contract.

## Blocked material

The following are not handbook migration inputs unless a separate review explicitly permits them:

- game managed assemblies or native binaries;
- BepInEx or Unity runtime binaries;
- compiled mod DLLs and release archives;
- wholesale decompiled game source;
- saves, credentials, private paths, unredacted logs, screenshots with private data, and live diagnostic dumps;
- upstream Tainted Interface visual payloads currently recorded with unresolved redistribution status;
- Git LFS payloads or third-party assets without an exact licence and redistribution decision;
- generated failed-incident bundles except redacted, approved evidence summaries.

## Inventory expansion rule

This map records source groups. Phase 1 must expand it into file-level inventory rows before claiming complete coverage. Each row must include exact source path, blob or commit identity, content class, decision, destination owner, profile scope, licence state, migration status, and any research or validation blocker.
