# Tainted Grail Hook Catalogue

This folder contains exact, version-bound records for reviewed game extension points, patch targets, events, services, reflection targets, data handoffs, and adapter boundaries.

A hook record is documentation and evidence. It is not permission to patch a game installation or execute runtime code.

## Hook classes

- `lifecycle` — startup, scene, pause, shutdown, save, or service availability;
- `method-patch` — Harmony prefix, postfix, finalizer, or transpiler target;
- `event` — subscribed event or callback surface;
- `service` — resolved singleton, registry, manager, or interface;
- `reflection` — guarded member/type lookup where no stable public surface exists;
- `data` — reviewed read/write data structure or serialization handoff;
- `ui` — view, controller, input, HUD, menu, prompt, or localization surface;
- `asset` — addressable/resource/material/audio/VFX/animation loading surface;
- `adapter` — Mono, IL2CPP, BepInEx, Unity, or SDK boundary;
- `extension-api` — FOA-SDK public ExtensionAPI surface.

## Promotion rules

1. A patch occurrence in source creates only a `candidate` record.
2. An exact type/member match against the intended profile permits `signature-verified`.
3. Successful plugin load and patch registration permits `load-verified`.
4. Controlled evidence of intended behavior permits `behavior-verified`.
5. Combined-mod/load-order testing and reviewed risks permit `compatibility-reviewed`.
6. A new game patch does not inherit an old status. The hook remains bound to its original profile until reverified.
7. A helper or controller does not inherit safety, cleanup, or validation from its caller. Configuration gates and `try/catch` wrappers are source facts, not promotion evidence.
8. A fixture specification is not an executed fixture result. Profile binding without the required assembly fingerprints and observations creates no promotion evidence.
9. A deterministic adverse implementation finding may produce `prohibited-current-source` without claiming that the underlying modding goal is permanently impossible.
10. An offline specification receipt has no runtime or promotion authority.
11. Synthetic locking, recovery, concurrency, cancellation, serialization and CI policy tests do not establish game-runtime behavior.
12. Journal proofs, abandonment reviews, publication intents and reproducible CI receipts remain synthetic project facts and grant no runtime or promotion authority.

## Evidence boundary

Hook records may contain concise type/member/signature facts and small permitted excerpts needed to identify the target. They must not contain wholesale decompiled source, game assemblies, private paths, unredacted runtime dumps, or unsupported ownership claims.

## Catalogue work order

The extraction programme will:

1. inventory every `HarmonyPatch`, patch registration, reflection lookup, event subscription, manager/service lookup, and runtime adapter handoff in the pinned source repository;
2. group duplicates by intended target and profile;
3. assign stable hook IDs;
4. record candidate evidence and uncertainty;
5. reconcile targets against current exact game profiles;
6. connect reviewed hooks to system pages, examples, and compatibility records.

## Completed semantic batches

### Batch 001

[Semantic Hook Batch 001](BATCH_001.md) dispositions seven selected source files into ten candidates, one source-system fact, one decomposition blocker, and one explicit rejection.

Candidate records:

- [NPC non-critical death completion](records/ACTORS_NPC_DEATH.md)
- [Readable steal completion](records/CRIME_READABLE_STEAL.md)
- [Cloud-service EndSave family](records/PERSISTENCE_CLOUD_END_SAVE.md)
- [Menu initialization and options-button lookup](records/UI_MENU_INITIALIZE.md)

Other outcomes:

- [Avalon Mounts aggregation blocker](blockers/AVALON_MOUNTS_PLUGIN.md)
- [Template ExamplePatch rejection](rejections/TEMPLATE_EXAMPLE_PATCH.md)
- [Economy patch registrar fact](../systems/items-economy/PATCH_REGISTRATION_FACT.md)

### Batch 002

[Semantic Hook Batch 002](BATCH_002.md) decomposes Avalon Mounts and processes the first eight Tainted Economy registrar callers.

Candidate records:

- [Seven Avalon Mounts runtime targets](records/MOUNTS_RUNTIME_TARGETS.md)
- [Crafting and recipe UI](records/ECONOMY_CRAFTING_RECIPE.md)
- [Harvest yield](records/ECONOMY_HARVEST.md)
- [Reward and wealth routes](records/ECONOMY_REWARDS.md)
- [Service-cost getters](records/ECONOMY_SERVICE_COSTS.md)
- [Container loot](records/ECONOMY_CONTAINER_LOOT.md)
- [Vendor price](records/ECONOMY_VENDOR_PRICE.md)

Other outcomes:

- [Avalon Mounts lifecycle/frame/compatibility facts](../systems/mounts/AVALON_MOUNTS_RUNTIME_FACTS.md)
- [Avalon Mounts diagnostics/privacy blocker](blockers/AVALON_MOUNTS_DIAGNOSTICS_PRIVACY.md)
- [Resolved aggregate blocker history](blockers/AVALON_MOUNTS_PLUGIN.md)
- [Processed economy registrar fact](../systems/items-economy/PATCH_REGISTRATION_FACT.md)

Batch 002 adds 27 source-only candidate records and promotes none.

### Batch 003

[Semantic Hook Batch 003](BATCH_003.md) reviews thirteen downstream economy helper files and the two Avalon Mounts frame-ticked controllers without inheriting safety or validation from their callers.

Candidate adapter records:

- [Avalon Companions dialogue registration and cleanup](records/MOUNTS_AVALON_COMPANIONS_DIALOGUE_BRIDGE.md)

Canonical source facts:

- [Economy helper semantics](../systems/items-economy/HELPER_SEMANTICS_FACTS.md)
- [Resolved mount frame-controller behavior](../systems/mounts/AVALON_MOUNTS_RUNTIME_FACTS.md)

Research blockers:

- [Economy reflection, pricing, quantity, protection, and reward mutation](blockers/ECONOMY_HELPER_SAFETY.md)
- [Wolf mount seat frame controller and native contract ownership](blockers/WOLF_MOUNT_SEAT_CONTROLLER.md)

Batch 003 dispositions fifteen selected files into two source-only adapter candidates, seven canonical helper facts, and seven blockers. It promotes none.

### Batch 004

[Semantic Hook Batch 004](BATCH_004.md) binds the Batch 003 high-risk surfaces to the exact Mono handbook profile, specifies deterministic fixtures, and records explicit promotion-or-prohibition decisions.

- [fixture contract and evidence ceiling](fixtures/README.md)
- [Batch 004 decision register](decisions/BATCH_004_PROMOTION_PROHIBITION.md)

Batch 004 adds four specification-only manifests containing 33 deterministic cases, accepts two source facts, records seven `prohibited-current-source` decisions, and promotes no hook.

### Batch 005

[Semantic Hook Batch 005](BATCH_005.md) defines source repairs and adds a project-owned offline fixture runner without runtime or promotion authority.

- [source-repair designs](repairs/BATCH_005_SOURCE_REPAIR_DESIGNS.md)
- [offline runner guide](fixtures/OFFLINE_RUNNER.md)

Batch 005 adds a standard-library runner and eight tests. It leaves every Batch 004 prohibition unchanged and promotes nothing.

### Batch 006

[Semantic Hook Batch 006](BATCH_006.md) implements inert typed transactions, diagnostic utilities, synthetic mount rollback, API v2 registry state and deterministic runner goldens.

Batch 006 adds eleven synthetic tests and promotes nothing.

### Batch 007

[Semantic Hook Batch 007](BATCH_007.md) hardens the synthetic primitives into a reusable package with explicit state machines, hash-chained recovery journals, failure matrices, API v2 serialization fixtures and read-only offline CI.

Batch 007 adds no runtime adapter or evidence authority and leaves every existing prohibition unchanged.

### Batch 008

[Semantic Hook Batch 008](BATCH_008.md) adds owner/generation locks, deterministic recovery plans, two-writer publication fixtures, cancellation checkpoints, stale-generation API v2 snapshots and negative CI policy tests.

Batch 008 preserves the complete no-runtime and no-promotion boundary and leaves every existing prohibition unchanged.

### Batch 009

[Semantic Hook Batch 009](BATCH_009.md) adds terminal-journal compaction proofs, lock-abandonment review records, recoverable multi-file publication intents, cancellation/recovery goldens, bounded API generation gaps and reproducible CI policy receipts.

Batch 009 preserves the complete no-runtime and no-promotion boundary and leaves every existing prohibition unchanged.

## Initial domain indexes

Planned hook indexes:

- bootstrap and lifecycle;
- player and input;
- actors and troops;
- combat and progression;
- items, crafting, vendors, loot, and rewards;
- quests, dialogue, events, and world state;
- spawns, encounters, navigation, and cleanup;
- world, scenes, map, travel, and roads;
- UI, HUD, menus, prompts, and localization;
- audio, VFX, animation, materials, and assets;
- AI and blackboards;
- saves, persistence, configuration, and migration;
- frameworks, dependencies, compatibility, and diagnostics.

No domain is considered covered merely because one historical mod patched it.
