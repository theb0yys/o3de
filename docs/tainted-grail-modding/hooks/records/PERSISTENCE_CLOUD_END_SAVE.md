# Candidate Hook Family — Cloud Service EndSave

The source enumerates four concrete cloud-service types and resolves `EndSave(string)` on each. Each type receives its own hook ID because compatibility and target availability may differ by platform or game build.

## Steam cloud service

```yaml
hook_id: tg.hook.persistence.steam-cloud-end-save
title: Steam cloud save completion observer
status: candidate
hook_class: method-patch
domain: saves-and-persistence
purpose: observe SteamCloudService EndSave completion and enqueue the completed slot identifier for a mod-owned backup workflow
profile:
  game_version: unknown
  branch: unknown
  runtime: Mono
  loader: BepInEx v5 Mono; exact version unknown
  framework: Harmony from the local BepInEx installation; exact version unknown
target:

context:
  lifecycle_point: after the selected cloud service ends a save operation
  thread: unknown
  frequency: event
  inputs: string slotId
  outputs: Plugin.NotifySaveSlotWritten(slotId)
  side_effects: queues a slot identifier; downstream code may read slot files and write a plugin-owned ZIP backup

## Extracted source facts

The target enumerator resolves each type by full name, then requests `EndSave` with exactly one `string` parameter. Missing types or methods are silently omitted from the enumerable target set. The postfix forwards the slot identifier to a concurrent queue. The owning plug-in drains that queue during `Update`; downstream code may read the completed slot and create a plugin-owned ZIP archive.

Because this source sits on a save-completion boundary, source plausibility is nowhere near enough. Exact flush ordering, failure behavior, duplicate notifications, platform variants, save-mod collisions, and rollback must be proven before promotion.
