# Core and Framework Build-Graph Contract

## Status

Accepted correction contract for Slice 5 and extended by Slices 6, 7, 8, and 9. The build graph decomposes editor-side implementation into real targets without changing durable schemas, runtime permissions, deployment, game launch, or save behavior.

## Targets

### `TaintedGrailModdingSDK.Core.Static`

Owns shared domain state and services that are free of Qt and host-tool dependencies:

- workspace, pack, source, evidence, catalog, governance, and economy models;
- catalog database and publish-after-save transaction logic;
- governance types and governance blocker evaluation;
- foundation validation, economy blocker evaluation, and immutable economy acquisition coverage and cross-pack duplicate analysis;
- typed transient adapter declarations, strict semantic-version compatibility, capability evaluation, and permission/proof readiness analysis;
- deterministic, canonical, execution-prohibited adapter work-order planning;
- the source/evidence registry.

Core depends publicly on `AZ::AzCore`. Core must not depend on Framework, Editor, Qt, AzToolsFramework, runtime adapters, deployment, or game APIs.

### `TaintedGrailModdingSDK.Framework.Static`

Owns editor-side orchestration, persistence, and services that currently require host-tool or Qt facilities:

- `FoundationService` composition and domain command implementations;
- governance decision, evidence promotion, and economy authoring services that use Qt-backed timestamps or normalisation;
- workspace candidate loading and atomic publication support;
- workspace schema, canonical path, pack, catalog, source/evidence, and workspace persistence;
- source import and the Foundation notification contract.

Framework depends publicly on Core and privately on the host-tool facilities needed by persistence and editor-side orchestration. Framework must not own widgets, the Editor module, or the Editor system component.

### `TaintedGrailModdingSDK.Editor`

Remains the Tool Gem module and owns only composition and presentation:

- Qt widgets, including the read-only economy acquisition, duplicate-report, adapter-capability, and work-order-plan panes;
- the Editor system component;
- the Gem Editor module.

Editor depends privately on Framework. It does not recompile Core or Framework sources.

## Tests

Tests link Framework and receive Core transitively. Test manifests contain test translation units and included test fragments only. Production `.cpp` files are compiled exactly once by Core, Framework, or Editor; tests do not compile private copies of production implementation files.

## Dependency direction

```text
AZ::AzCore
    ↓
Core.Static
    ↓
Framework.Static
    ↓
Editor

Framework.Static
    ↓
Catalog.Tests
```

The test arrow means the test target links Framework; it does not reverse the production dependency direction.

## Source-location policy

This correction changes build ownership, not include paths or public C++ namespaces. Existing files remain under `Code/Source` so the split does not create an unrelated filesystem migration. The CMake manifests are the authoritative ownership map.

Qt-dependent services are deliberately Framework-owned rather than being labelled Core while retaining hidden Qt coupling. Moving one of those services into Core later requires first removing its Qt and host-tool dependencies under a separate reviewed change. New Core analysis services must follow the same pure dependency boundary.

The adapter declaration registry is deliberately transient Core state. It has no persistence service, document schema, filesystem path, loader integration, process access, or runtime implementation. Editor shutdown clears the registry.

Work-order planning is also transient Core state. It reads immutable packs, declarations, catalog state, source/evidence, governance history, and blockers; returns plans or refusals by value; and performs no filesystem, persistence, process, deployment, launch, telemetry, or save operation.

## Enforcement

`validate_core_framework_build_graph.py` fails when:

- a production `.cpp` is unowned or owned by more than one target;
- a test manifest recompiles production sources;
- Core owns persistence, path, import, orchestration, UI, or Editor files;
- Core includes Qt, AzToolsFramework, or a Framework-owned header;
- Framework owns UI or Editor-module files;
- Editor owns non-composition production sources;
- CMake reverses or bypasses the Core → Framework → Editor direction;
- Tool or Builder aliases expose internal static targets;
- the obsolete path-policy Editor manifest returns.

Feature-specific validators add stricter contracts for individual Core analyses and Editor views. The economy coverage validator rejects Qt or mutation dependencies in the coverage service and editing controls in its dashboard. The economy duplicate validator additionally enforces exact case-sensitive signals, distinct-pack gating, no display-name or fuzzy identity matching, pure Core ownership, and a non-editable report.

The adapter-contract validator additionally enforces:

- typed adapter identity, strict semantic versions, exact runtime targets, and all eleven capabilities;
- deterministic `unsupported`, `version_mismatch`, `permission_missing`, `proof_missing`, and `supported` results;
- transient declaration storage with no adapter persistence document;
- exact profile-bound adapter, permission, and validation proof;
- a non-editable matrix;
- no runtime behavior in the contract foundation.

The work-order-plan validator additionally enforces:

- all-eleven-capability support before a candidate can generate;
- independent exact subject, permission, proof, payload, relationship, target, and blocker rebuilding;
- stable plan and step identities;
- canonical sorting and JSON serialization;
- `ExecutionAllowed: false` at plan and step level;
- no work-order persistence, export, dispatch, adapter invocation, runtime code, or mutable UI control;
- production-linked failure, determinism, and non-mutation tests.

## Runtime boundary

No runtime adapter is added. No FoA, Unity, BepInEx, Harmony, deployment, injection, telemetry, game launch, save mutation, or work-order execution code is introduced or authorized. Core and Framework remain host-tool implementation targets inside the existing Tool Gem.

## Rollback

Revert the implementing pull request. No durable documents or user state require migration because these slices change build ownership and add transient or derived read-only analysis and planning only.
