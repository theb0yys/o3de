## Documentation authority

When documents conflict, use this order:

1. security policy and licence obligations;
2. governance and review policy;
3. architecture and data-format contracts;
4. code-quality standard;
5. user and development guides;
6. examples and issue discussions.

A merged architecture decision or schema migration may supersede an older section. The change must update the affected documentation in the same pull request.

## Current product status

The project is pre-alpha. Current implemented editor workflows cover:

- workspace and exact game profile;
- mod and content-pack projects;
- source and evidence intake;
- canonical catalog browser, record inspector, first-class relationships, validation history, and reviewed claim promotion;
- foundation status, coverage, import issues, and blockers.

The next active slice expands the independent maturity, confidence, operational-risk, validation, permission, and prohibition engine. Domain authoring tools, runtime adapters, and production deployment are not complete.

## Documentation contribution rules

Documentation changes must:

- describe current behavior honestly;
- distinguish implemented, planned, and experimental behavior;
- avoid publishing proprietary game content or private paths;
- use stable internal links;
- update examples when schemas change;
- include migration notes for breaking changes;
- use clear, direct language and define project-specific terms.
