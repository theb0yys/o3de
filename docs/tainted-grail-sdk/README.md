## Documentation authority

When documents conflict, use this order:

1. security policy and licence obligations;
2. governance and review policy;
3. architecture and data-format contracts;
4. code-quality standard;
5. user and development guides;
6. examples and issue discussions.

A merged architecture decision or schema migration may supersede an older section. The change must update the affected documentation in the same pull request.

## Current product status

The project is pre-alpha. Current implemented editor workflows cover:

- internal `Core.Static` and `Framework.Static` build targets with one-way dependencies, unique production-source ownership, and tests linked to production libraries instead of recompiling them;
- durable workspace schema 1 with validated schema-0 migration and atomic all-or-nothing workspace transitions;
- workspace and exact game profile;
- mod and content-pack projects;
- source and evidence intake;
- canonical catalog browsing, relationships, validation history, governance history, and reviewed claim promotion;
- independent maturity, confidence, risk, validation, staleness, permission, prohibition, and supersession;
- typed atomic governance and publish-after-save catalog transactions;
- typed item and recipe profiles, joins, station references, and acquisition relationships;
- read-only action lanes, station/learnability evidence rows, economy acquisition coverage, and exact cross-pack duplicate candidate reports;
- typed transient adapter declarations, semantic-version compatibility, capability/permission/proof evaluation, and a read-only adapter capability matrix;
- deterministic transient adapter work-order plans and refusals with canonical JSON and execution disabled;
- typed transient runtime-result envelopes with exact plan/step/recovery/log binding and candidate source/evidence return that does not promote validation or permission;
- Developer Preview 0 prerequisite checks, configure/build wrapping, deterministic synthetic fixture, SHA-256 verification, and service-level load/save/reopen smoke coverage;
- canonical workspace and pack path enforcement with component containment and filesystem-link escape rejection;
- dedicated `TaintedGrailModdingEditor` O3DE project with `TaintedGrailModdingSDK` enabled and project-owned PNG/ICO assets;
- generated `Tainted Grail Modding Editor.lnk` whose trusted target, project, working directory and icon are derived from repository-owned policy rather than its sidecar;
- explicit diagnostic-only shortcut overrides that cannot replace or verify as the standard entry;
- command-line opening through `developer_preview_open.py`;
- explicit local diagnostics collection with path/secret redaction, allow-listed files, log excerpts, workspace-relative hashes, manifest verification, and no automatic upload;
- Windows manual UI checklist and screenshot-evidence tooling with exact-commit binding, PNG hashes, required coverage, and privacy/runtime attestations.

The actual Windows screenshot pass remains pending. Runtime adapters, production deployment, live result capture, and remaining specialised domain tools are not complete.

## Documentation contribution rules

Documentation changes must describe current behavior honestly, distinguish implemented from planned behavior, avoid proprietary content and private paths, use stable links, and include migration notes for breaking format changes.
