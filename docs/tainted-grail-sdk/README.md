- [Roadmap](../../ROADMAP.md)
- [Changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md)

## Documentation authority

When documents conflict, use this order:

1. security policy and licence obligations;
2. governance and review policy;
3. architecture and data-format contracts;
4. code-quality standard;
5. user and development guides;
6. examples and issue discussions.

A merged architecture decision or schema migration may supersede an older section. The change must update the affected documentation in the same pull request.

## Current product status

The project is pre-alpha. Current implemented editor workflows cover:

- internal `Core.Static` and `Framework.Static` build targets with one-way dependencies, unique production-source ownership, and tests linked to production libraries instead of recompiling them;
- durable workspace schema 1 with validated schema-0 migration and atomic all-or-nothing workspace transitions;
- workspace, exact game profiles, packs, source/evidence intake, canonical catalog, validation, governance, and blockers;
- typed item/recipe authoring, station/learnability evidence, economy acquisition coverage, and exact cross-pack duplicate candidates;
- typed transient adapter declarations, capability compatibility, deterministic work-order plans, and typed runtime-result evidence candidates;
- deterministic transient adapter build-manifest definitions with exact toolchain/material/output declarations and `BuildAllowed` disabled;
- deterministic transient package-assembly previews with accepted manifest reviews, project-owned staging inventories, exact package layouts and output digests, omissions, collisions, redistribution blockers, and all assembly/archive/deployment permissions disabled;
- deterministic transient staging/deployment previews with accepted target reviews, exact target inventories, additions, replacements, removals, unchanged paths, conflicts, backups, rollback steps, and all mutation/launch permissions disabled;
- typed transient deployment confirmations and work orders with exact scope, expiry, maintenance windows, preflight evidence, deterministic operator steps/checklists, and all execution/mutation permissions disabled;
- typed transient deployment execution-result envelopes with exact work-order/executor binding, attempted steps, backup/restore outcomes, target verification, rollback, safe logs, and candidate evidence returned without automatic promotion;
- deterministic post-deployment reports with exact current-work-order/candidate-evidence binding, target-verification and rollback analysis, explicit compatibility/release blockers, mandatory human review, and no independent verifier or release publication path;
- typed transient independent-verifier result envelopes with exact canonical-report binding, reviewed verifier capabilities, one check per mutation step, independent observations, typed failures, safe diagnostics, and candidate evidence returned without automatic promotion;
- deterministic transient verifier-evidence reconciliations with preserved blockers, separate compatibility/release/human-review axes, typed dispositions, canonical JSON, and no automatic approval, signing, or publication;
- Developer Preview validation, deterministic synthetic fixtures, controlled Editor launch, diagnostics, and exact-commit Windows manual UI evidence tooling.

Automatic GitHub Actions triggers are currently suspended; the local validation command is the documented test gate and no automated per-commit result is claimed.

The actual Windows screenshot pass remains pending. Trusted identity/time providers, actual verifier execution and target access, acknowledgement, toolchain resolution, compilation, file-backed staging/target inventory, package copying/archiving, backup/restore, release-artifact hashing/signing/publication, runtime adapters, production deployment, live executor capture, and remaining specialised domain tools are not complete.

## Documentation contribution rules

Documentation changes must describe current behavior honestly, distinguish implemented from planned behavior, avoid proprietary content and private paths, use stable links, and include migration notes for breaking format changes.
