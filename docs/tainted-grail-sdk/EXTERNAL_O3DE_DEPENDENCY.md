# External O3DE dependency boundary

Status: extraction preparation contract.

FOA-SDK is the product. O3DE is the authoring engine dependency. The supported
layout separates three roots:

```text
Development/
├── FOA-SDK/      product_root
├── o3de/         engine_root
└── foa-build/    build_root
```

The roots must not contain one another. Generated build, validation, diagnostics,
screenshot, installer, and release outputs do not belong in either source
checkout.

## Exact engine lock

`o3de.lock.json` is the machine-readable engine contract. The initial reviewed
pin is:

```text
repository: https://github.com/o3de/o3de.git
commit: 68683f23fb747380d3efa2424bd5f30242e9c5a2
engine: o3de
version: 2.7.0
```

The commit is the upstream O3DE commit titled `O3DE Fetch Content (#19622)`.
Developer Preview commands fail closed when the checkout does not resolve to
that exact commit or when `engine.json` reports a different engine identity.

The lock may be changed only through a reviewed dependency-update pull request
that includes configure, build, compiled-test, and Editor acceptance evidence.

## Resolution order

The Developer Preview coordinator resolves `engine_root` in this order:

1. explicit `--engine-root`;
2. `FOA_O3DE_ROOT`;
3. the sibling directory named by `checkout_directory`;
4. the current combined source tree as a temporary migration fallback.

The fourth route exists only so this contract can land before history
extraction. It must be removed after the FOA-only repository has passed its
clean-clone acceptance gate.

The build root resolves from explicit `--build-dir`, then `FOA_BUILD_ROOT`, then
the sibling `foa-build/` directory.

## Configure boundary

CMake configuration is engine-owned while the project is product-owned:

```text
cmake --preset windows-vs-unity
  -S <engine_root>
  -B <build_root>/tg-sdk-developer-preview-0-windows-profile
  -A x64
  -DLY_PROJECTS=<product_root>/TaintedGrailModdingEditor
```

FOA validators execute from `product_root`. The O3DE source-policy validator is
resolved from `engine_root`. The compiled tests execute from `build_root`.

## Extraction gates

The repository history extraction is not part of this contract change. It may
begin only after all of the following pass against the external sibling engine:

1. prerequisite and exact-pin verification;
2. configure from `engine_root`;
3. Profile Editor and AssetProcessorBatch build;
4. all focused Python validators;
5. O3DE source-policy validation of both custom Gems;
6. compiled catalog and framework tests;
7. Editor entry and pane acceptance;
8. generated-output hygiene checks.

The extraction must preserve current FOA paths first. Directory reorganisation
comes later.

## FOA-O3DE decision

Do not create `FOA-O3DE` merely to hold inherited engine content. Create it only
if the changed-path audit proves that FOA requires intentional modifications to
stock O3DE files and those changes cannot be implemented through the FOA
project or custom Gems.

Until such evidence exists, the expected maintained repositories are:

```text
FOA-SDK    maintained product repository
o3de       pinned upstream checkout
FOA-O3DE   absent
```

## History extraction

Deleting O3DE directories in a normal commit is not sufficient because the
engine remains in clone history and repository objects. The later history
extraction unit must use a reviewed filtered-history procedure, verify the
result against the recorded source head, preserve tags or archival references
deliberately, and publish a migration notice before replacing the default
product history.
