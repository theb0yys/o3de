# Source Register

Baseline commit for pre-change repository observations:
`92aa29960bab92d646c464ae48b8cf09d881a436` (`FOA-plug-in-development`). Gate 0 entries marked "this commit"
refer to the exact Git commit containing this register, so the containing commit ID is their durable revision.

External retrieval date unless otherwise stated: 20 July 2026.

Registering a source does not approve a component, version, licence, experiment, or operation. Exact versions
must be rechecked at the gate that would consume them.

## Repository sources

Unless explicitly marked "this commit", paths in this section were observed at the baseline commit above.

| ID | Repository path | Supports | Limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SRC-REPO-001` | `README.md` | Pre-alpha status; governed O3DE editor; no safe runtime-executor claim | Project status can change after this commit |
| `SRC-REPO-002` | `docs/tainted-grail-sdk/ARCHITECTURE.md` | O3DE host/Unity runtime separation; Core, Framework, Editor, diagnostic, and runtime-adapter ownership | Does not approve a concrete runtime adapter |
| `SRC-REPO-003` | `docs/tainted-grail-sdk/EDITOR_TOOLCHAIN_UNITY_INTERCHANGE_DESIGN.md` | This commit: approved inert Core-only Gate 0; Blender-first provider program; file interchange; identities; losses; and Gates 1–13 | Gate 0 is in development; broader Phase 9 provider/execution program remains proposed |
| `SRC-REPO-004` | `ROADMAP.md` | This commit: Gate 0 contract-only exception, Phase 9 entry for Gates 1+, ecosystem ordering, and Unity Editor/runtime separation | Gate 0 adds no service, process, filesystem, provider, build, deployment, or runtime authority |
| `SRC-REPO-005` | `docs/tainted-grail-sdk/SDK_FUNCTIONAL_EXPANSION_PROGRAM.md` | First-party capability items 1–7 before extension/automation; shared layer rules | Does not approve a provider version |
| `SRC-REPO-006` | `Gems/ExternalToolchain/gem.json` | `ExternalToolchain` Gem version `0.2.0` | Gem version is distinct from host API version |
| `SRC-REPO-007` | `Gems/ExternalToolchain/Code/Include/ExternalToolchain/ExternalToolchainTypes.h` | Host API `1.1.0`; `EngineBridge` family; typed provider descriptors | Current API has no execution service |
| `SRC-REPO-008` | `Gems/ExternalToolchain/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Generic host ownership, discovery-only current state, and ordered follow-on work | Follow-on list is not implementation authority |
| `SRC-REPO-009` | `Gems/ExternalToolchain/docs/DISCOVERY_AND_CONFIGURATION.md` | Configured-path-only discovery; no interrogation, recursive scan, registry scan, package-manager scan, or execution | Configured versions are caller inputs, not executable observations |
| `SRC-REPO-010` | `Code/Framework/AzFramework/AzFramework/Process/ProcessWatcher.h` and platform implementations | Existing O3DE process-launch primitive, vector/string command parameter representation, tether flag | A primitive does not prove secure supervision, cancellation, process-tree cleanup, or sandboxing |
| `SRC-REPO-011` | `docs/tainted-grail-sdk/FOA_ADAPTER_WORK_ORDER_PLANS.md` | Canonical runtime work-order plans retain `ExecutionAllowed: false` | Plans are not executable handoffs |
| `SRC-REPO-012` | `docs/tainted-grail-sdk/FOA_ADAPTER_BUILD_MANIFESTS.md` | Build manifests retain `BuildAllowed: false` | Manifests do not compile or package output |
| `SRC-REPO-013` | `docs/tainted-grail-sdk/FOA_ADAPTER_RUNTIME_RESULT_EVIDENCE.md` | Typed runtime-result candidate-evidence concepts | Runtime evidence is not a generic process-result contract |
| `SRC-REPO-014` | `docs/tainted-grail-sdk/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` | Package, confirmation, deployment, verification, and release authority remain separately gated | Current contracts do not invoke an executor |
| `SRC-REPO-015` | `docs/tainted-grail-sdk/LEGAL_AND_CONTENT_POLICY.md` | Allowed original/synthetic material and prohibited proprietary/private contributions | Project policy is not legal advice or a blanket licence determination |
| `SRC-REPO-016` | `Gems/AtomLyIntegration/TechnicalArt/DccScriptingInterface/` | In-tree DCC bootstrap and Blender prototype material exists | Presence does not establish current Blender compatibility or qualification |
| `SRC-REPO-017` | `Gems/SceneProcessing/` | Scene-processing Gem exists in the fork | Existence does not prove project activation or the planned interchange handoff |
| `SRC-REPO-018` | `docs/tainted-grail-sdk/EXTERNAL_TOOL_INTERCHANGE_GATE_0.md` | This commit: exact Gate 0 contracts, disabled authority matrix, pure validation, and acceptance boundary | Gate 0 is in development and grants no permission to begin Gate 1 |

## Sources not yet durable

The supplied report still refers to official store/news material, Unity licensing terms, Addressables
documentation, BepInEx release channels, and community reports about FoA Mono/IL2CPP branches only through
opaque `turn...` citations. Until the exact direct URL, relevant version or revision, retrieval date, and
scoped claim are added here, those claims remain `unverified` and cannot authorize design or implementation.
