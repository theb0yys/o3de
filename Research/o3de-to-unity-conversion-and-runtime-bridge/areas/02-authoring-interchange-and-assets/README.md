# Authoring Interchange and Assets

## Scope

This area covers project-owned or synthetic authoring content exchanged among Blender, O3DE, and a synthetic
or user-owned Unity Editor test project. It does not cover a proprietary FoA project or a running game.

## Contract topics

- one versioned `manifest.tginterchange.json` package boundary;
- stable `PackageId`, `AssetId`, `RevisionFingerprint`, `BindingId`, and `MappingId` identities;
- exact native bindings without treating display names or paths as identity;
- contained relative payload paths, byte sizes, media types, and SHA-256 observations;
- explicit coordinate basis, units, transform order, pivot, timebase, and conversion matrices;
- bounded mesh, texture, material, skeleton, animation, collider, and metadata declarations;
- provenance, authorship, licence, attribution, modification, and redistribution state;
- ordered transformations, typed losses, external qualification evidence, and exact toolchain locks;
- reverse and round-trip behavior with declared numeric tolerances.

Gate 0 owns inert Core-only outer handoff/result envelopes. No service consumes them and every authority and
performed flag remains false. A later process operation may bind the interchange package through those
envelopes, but the envelopes do not replace its identity, transformation, provenance, and loss contracts.

## Accepted research conclusion

[`CANONICAL_INTERCHANGE_SCHEMA_AND_IDENTITY_RESEARCH.md`](CANONICAL_INTERCHANGE_SCHEMA_AND_IDENTITY_RESEARCH.md)
answers the focused Schema-1 structure and identity question.

The conclusion was written against `504e10b27e46fceae4d68af200118edca27b4d1b` and reconciled through
`3d50df1ea3aaf97a5148ae4ebb5c5ade8336e6d2` by
[`CURRENT_MAIN_RECONCILIATION_2026-07-22.md`](CURRENT_MAIN_RECONCILIATION_2026-07-22.md). The Gate 5 design is
based on later `main` commit `eb840862c9d3e239dec91770495c7669c00d10df` and reconciled through
`3fb95284f7cbc259a3c4ab0ba4469be0c9d7baaf` by the current-main design reconciliation.

The accepted research direction is:

```text
one authoritative manifest
+ typed engine-neutral domain documents
+ contained ordered payload inventory
+ exact native bindings
+ first-class identity mapping events
+ bounded extension namespaces
+ external Framework-owned qualification evidence
```

Schema 1 is directory-only. It uses a dedicated `foa-interchange-canonical-json-v1` profile, ASCII semantic
tokens, engine-neutral identities, explicit migration, deterministic blocker codes, and the fixed canonical basis
`+X` right, `+Y` forward, `+Z` up, right-handed, metres, radians, and seconds. Matrices use column vectors,
matrix-on-left multiplication, and column-major storage.

The accepted conclusion remains research-only and grants no implementation or operational authority.

## Proposed Gate 5 contract design

[`GATE_5_CONTRACT_IMPLEMENTATION_DESIGN_QUESTION.md`](GATE_5_CONTRACT_IMPLEMENTATION_DESIGN_QUESTION.md) is
answered by:

- [`../../../../../docs/tainted-grail-sdk/CANONICAL_INTERCHANGE_GATE_5_DESIGN.md`](../../../../../docs/tainted-grail-sdk/CANONICAL_INTERCHANGE_GATE_5_DESIGN.md);
- [`../../../../../docs/tainted-grail-sdk/CANONICAL_INTERCHANGE_GATE_5_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`](../../../../../docs/tainted-grail-sdk/CANONICAL_INTERCHANGE_GATE_5_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md);
- [`../../../../../docs/tainted-grail-sdk/CANONICAL_INTERCHANGE_GATE_5_CURRENT_MAIN_RECONCILIATION_2026-07-22.md`](../../../../../docs/tainted-grail-sdk/CANONICAL_INTERCHANGE_GATE_5_CURRENT_MAIN_RECONCILIATION_2026-07-22.md).

The proposed design fixes:

```text
Core type and file ownership
→ dedicated canonical parser/writer
→ intrinsic validator and exact issue ordering
→ pure migration dispatch
→ public schema package
→ Core-only compiled fixtures
→ source-tree consistency validation
→ explicit all-false authority matrix
```

The design is ready for maintainer review but is not implementation authority.

## Resolved design points

- Four exact Core translation-unit pairs own types, canonical bytes, validation, and migration.
- A dedicated test target links Core.Static and AzTest only.
- Core gains no Framework, Editor, Qt, filesystem, provider, host, or runtime dependency.
- Exact count, byte, path, token, digest, and nesting limits are selected.
- JSON tokens retain the research-approved hyphenated spellings.
- UTF-8 presentation strings are preserved without NFC normalization.
- Optional `display_name` is omitted when empty rather than normalized to an empty property.
- The intrinsic and reserved cross-layer issue-code inventories are complete.
- Schema-1 migration supports exact `1 -> 1` identity and fails closed for every unavailable route.
- The exact public schema, test, validator, and proposed changed-file layout is selected.
- Every operational capability remains absent or false.

## Design validation boundary

A design PR must pass the repository's exact-head hosted static validation. That result proves document, policy,
fixture, and repository-contract consistency only. It does not prove the proposed C++ contracts compile, the
canonical bytes match compiled golden fixtures, or any Blender, O3DE round trip, Unity, runtime, deployment, save,
signing, publication, or compatibility behavior.

Those compiled and operational claims remain unavailable until a separately authorized implementation or later
gate produces the exact required evidence.

## Remaining gate decision

Implementation remains blocked until:

1. the Phase 9 entry prerequisite is explicitly accepted for Gate 5;
2. the proposed design and addendum receive explicit maintainer acceptance;
3. an authority record names the exact implementation base, contract-only scope, tests, evidence, and prohibited
   capabilities.

Exact Blender and Unity versions remain unqualified. Asset Processor candidate publication remains a later Gate 7
design. No cross-host compatibility claim exists without exact fixtures and accepted evidence.

## Authority boundary

Format documentation, accepted research, and an accepted design do not establish cross-engine compatibility or
implementation authority. Gate 6 and later remain closed. No format or round-trip claim becomes supported until
the exact adapters, hosts, profiles, and fixtures pass the applicable implementation gates.
